# Project 3 - Integrate a mobile website with animations in CSS

<b>Scenario</b>

You have just been recruited at Ohmyfood as a junior developer. Congratulations!

Ohmyfood is a new startup that wants to make a name for itself in the restaurant business. The objective is to develop a 100% mobile-friendly site that lists the menus of gourmet restaurants. In addition to having a classic reservation system, customers will be able to select the dishes they want for their meal so that they are ready when they arrive. No more wait times in restaurants!

You are one of the four lucky ones who have the chance to work on this project.

The team is composed of :

- Paul, the CTO of the future site.
- Emily, the UX designer, recruited to create the siteâ€™s UI design.
- Anissa, the sales representative in charge of canvassing the restaurants.
- You, in charge of the development of the site.

Anissa is in the process of contacting the restaurants for this project. When she runs into you at the coffee machine, she says: 

"Have you heard the news? Remember the sales manager of your favorite restaurant? I managed to convince him and three others to put their menus online! I'll send you the file with the four menus in the afternoon. It's up to you now!"

With the team, you decide that the prototype will contain these four menus.  

Here is the [brief](Resources/Creative Brief - Ohmyfood!.pdf) you draw up with the CTO, Paul.
Back at your desk, you find the [mock-ups](Resources/Projet 3 - ohmyfood EN/mockups) of the site in your mailbox, sent by Emily.

For this project you version all of your code with Git and GitHub with frequent commits so that you can follow the progress of your code and more easily publish the website online.

You now have all the elements you need to build this mobile site.
